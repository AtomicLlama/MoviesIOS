# Movies

This is the repo for our small Movie/Ticketing/SocialIntergration App

![This app is great! Trust us...](http://atomicllama.github.io/img/chicago/poster.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Our Movies App is a simple System built on the idea that going to the movies should be simpler and more social.
This App showcases social integration, a recomender system, and much more all around buying tickets.

This app will allow you to browse through Movies, check the showtimes, buy tickets to any Movie Theatre, coordinate going to the movies with your friends and even paying separatly while we ensure you are always up to date on the movies we know you want to see.

The service is available for iOS, Android, including wearables and of course through the web.
