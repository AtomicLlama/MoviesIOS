##Installation

###Cocoapods

The easiest way to get started is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
# The following is a Library of Swift.
pod 'PZPullToRefresh'
```

Then, run the following command:

```ruby
pod install
```

###Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate PZPullToRefresh into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "pixyzehn/PZPullToRefresh"
```

Run `carthage update`.

```bash
$ carthage update
```

###Other

Add the PZPullToRefresh (including PZPullToRefreshView.swift) folder into your project.
